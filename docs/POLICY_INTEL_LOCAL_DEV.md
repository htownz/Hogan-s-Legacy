# ActUp Policy Intel Local Development

This repo is too large and too coupled to run the whole legacy app cleanly for the new policy-intel product. The fastest path is to develop the new bounded context in isolation while keeping the legacy code available for reference.

## Recommended tools

- Docker Desktop
- VS Code
- VS Code Dev Containers extension
- GitHub Desktop or Git CLI
- Optional: DBeaver or use Adminer at http://localhost:8080

## First-time setup

1. Optional: copy `.env.policy-intel.example` to `.env` if you want to override defaults or add API keys
2. Start the local stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.policy-intel.yml up --build
```

3. In another terminal, push the policy-intel schema:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.policy-intel.yml exec policy-intel npm run db:push:policy-intel
```

4. Open:
   - API health: http://localhost:5050/health
   - Policy Intel API root: http://localhost:5050/api/intel
   - Adminer: http://localhost:8080

## VS Code devcontainer flow

1. Open the repo folder in VS Code.
2. Run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
3. After the container comes up, the post-create hook installs dependencies and pushes the schema.
4. Start the service from the VS Code terminal if needed:

```bash
npm run dev:policy-intel
```

## What is wired right now

- A dedicated `server/policy-intel/` service entrypoint
- A clean schema in `shared/schema-policy-intel.ts`
- Core tables for workspaces, watchlists, source documents, alerts, briefs, and jobs
- Basic API endpoints under `/api/intel/*`

## What to build next

1. Add source connectors:
   - Congress.gov
   - GovInfo
   - Regulations.gov
   - Texas Legislature Online
   - Texas Register / TAC
   - Texas Ethics Commission
2. Build evidence ingestion into `policy_intel_source_documents`
3. Add watchlist matching and alert reason generation
4. Add brief generation from stored evidence only
5. Add a lightweight React workspace for watchlists, alerts, dossiers, and briefs

## Suggested first story

Build one full pipeline for **Texas legislative RSS/TLO updates**:

1. fetch source item
2. store in `policy_intel_source_documents`
3. match against a watchlist
4. create `policy_intel_alerts`
5. review in a minimal dashboard

## Notes

- The legacy app currently imports many routes and initializes optional AI clients at module load time. That makes a full local boot brittle.
- This isolated service avoids that problem and gives you a clean path to the commercial product.
